# Datacenter Trace Files in the PlanetLab Format

This directory contains workload files that can be used to simulate execution of jobs 
from a PlanetLab real Datacenter trace file.
These files are originated from [CloudSim](http://cloudbus.org/cloudsim).

Each sub-directory contains traces from a specific date. 
Each file contains CPU utilization measured at every 5 minutes in PlanetLab VMs.

If you want to create simulations using such a files,
check out [CloudSim Plus](http://cloudsimplus.org) simulation framework.
